/**
 To enable background connections to the IVI this property needs to be set to YES (Default is NO). This property needs to be set before the SDK is started.

 @discussion Activating background connectivity changes the behaviour of the mySPIN.SDK. If you set this property to YES you'll have to manage the start and stop of mySPIN yourself by calling the start and stop methods whenever you want to connect or disconnect to the IVI. Being connected to the IVI will be different from showing the connected UI if you enable this setting. Therefore kMySPINConnectionStateDidChangeNotification is deprecated and the new notifications MySpinDidConnectToVehicleNotification, MySpinDidDisconnectFromVehicleNotification, MySpinWillShowConnectedUINotification and MySpinWillHideConnectedUINotification have been introduced to reflect the new behavior.
