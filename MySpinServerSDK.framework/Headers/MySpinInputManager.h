/**
 Every IVI that supports focus control contains a Back and a OK button. In addition they have one of the following options:
 - a knob which can rotate (counter-) clockwise
 - two buttons which correspond to previous/next
 - 4 way D-Pad with up/down/left/right
 It may be reasonable to show different layouts depending on this capability. E.g. on a collection view a singe line/row should be used when only 2 directions can be entered. And multiple lines/rows can be used if the connected system can send 4 directions in order to reduce the necessary clicks.
