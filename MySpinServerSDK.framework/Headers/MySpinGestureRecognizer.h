Interface MySpinRotationGestureRecognizer

When the user moves the fingers opposite each other in a circular motion,
the underlying view should rotate in a corresponding direction and speed.

Rotation is a continuous gesture. It begins when two touches have moved
enough to be considered a rotation. The gesture changes when a finger
moves while the two fingers are down. It ends when both fingers have lifted.

If more than two fingers touched, only the moves of the first two touched down
fingers will be used to determine a rotation.
